    #Speaker Narrator
You awaken in the middle of the night to the sound a low gutural growl followed by a strong thud against the ground and a tremor. 

You sluggishly stumble towards the window to find the root of the sound. Peeking you find something you were not expecting. 

Heavy snowfall piercing the veil of night that covered the town of Veliwood, which in itself wouldn't be considered strange, were it not for the fact that it is midsummer. Before you could gather your thoughts you hear a knock on your door. 

    #Show Eira
    #Place Outside
Confused, you saunter over to the door and open it to find a beautiful woman, white as snow from her long pointy ears to her bare feet, donning long snow white robes. 

    #Speaker Eira
\*Pant* *pant* Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to bother you on this gloomy night, but I'm afraid I got caught in the middle of the storm. May I please come in?

 * Of course, please come in.

        Having lived in Veliwood from the day you were born, you have amasse quite a bit of knowledge of not only the town, but of it's surroundings. This knowledge allows you to say with certainty that there is no hut in those woods.

        Now in the heat and comfort of the house, you take a moment to thoroughly examine her.
        
        She is a stunning woman. Her saphire eyes are highlighted by the porcelain tone of her skin.
        
        The long cascade of snow white that flows from atop her head ending on a blue hue on the tips that shapes her hair, resembles a melting icicle. Though some areas of her body seem to be frostbit she doesn't show the slightest sign of hypothermia.

Before you get a moment to retaliate Eira's mouth opens gleaming with a supernatural aura and a burst of frigid energy springs towards you completely freezing you in place. 

The last thing you see is her figure approaching to your frost statue of a body and whispering "Good riddance" as she cracks the statue.

The lady's charming visage abruptly transmogrifies into that of a white-scaled lizard-like beast with piercing draconic eyes and claws sprout from the tip of her fingers.

As your conciousness fades, you can help but ask yourself what would have happened had you been a good samaritan.

Eira looks at you right in the eye and the room falls silent for a moment. The guarded faÃ§ade she had been keeping during this whole time slowly drops as she looks at her abdomen, lifts her hand from it and looks right back at you.

    #Emotion Happy
    #Speaker Eira
Don't be too harsh, doctor.

    #Speaker Narrator
You kneel right before her and probe the area around the cut. She lets out muffled moans of pain as you feel the cut, it is deep and on the first stages of infection. 

Had you not decided to check it out, she might have died in less than an hour. Luckily for her, she stumbled upon the house of Veliwood's best (and only) doctor. 

You go to your office and pick some of your equipment and begin disinfecting the wound. Having washed it and cleaned it, you then sew it up. 

Eira is in pain all the way through the process, however she seems to have a high pain tolerance and keeps herself together all the way through it.

It is done!

    #Speaker Eira
Is it? Thank you very much, doctor. How may I repay your kindness?

    After readying up, you and Eira head to your clinic in the heart of Veliwood. On your way there you are stopped by many of the towns residents that seem curious about your companion and complain about the weather.

    You finally arrive at the clinic and waiting right in front of the door you find a whole line of people. 
    
    They all look at you and begin to berate you with complaints of aches and diseases of all kinds, most likely as a result of this sudden shift in the weather.
    
    Quickly going in, you explain the ropes of her new job to Eira and she starts taking note of the patients discomforts. 
    
    Surprisingly for how she presented herself, she is really capable at this job and your work load is cut in half by having someone taking notes for you.
    
    Not but four hours later you two have efficiently tended to all of your patients. 
    
    Some of them stay for a while to chit-chat with you and to inquire about your new partner and compliment her skills. After they all leave you are left alone with Eira again.

    You are right but...
    
    #Speaker You
    Trust me, this will go smoothly.
    
    -> flee_attempt
    
* We are staying.

    We can make them think you have nothing to do with this weather.
    
    #Speaker Eira
    Won't they be able to figure it out? They are professional hunters, they had me against the ropes when they fought me.
    
    #Speaker You
    Just leave the talking to me. I will figure something out, I promise.
    
    #Speaker Narrator
    The next morning comes and you invite the elven lady into your house as agreed upon last night.

    #Emotion Sad
    #Place Outside
    #Speaker Narrator
    You wait until the arranged hour and get to the door. You step outside, but can see nothing through the veil of night. Eira follows you and the two of you begin to slowly make your way towards the forest.
    
    #Speaker Narrator
    The stillness of night is pierced by a whistle as you see a bolt approach you at fast speed.
    
    * [*Push Eira*] -> bolt_death
    
    * Eira, duck!
    
    -> run
    
=== run ===

    #Speaker Narrator
She quickly ducks and the bolt flies over her head. You take her hand help her up and continue running.

    #Emotion Annoyed
#Speaker Eira
Hold on tightly.

    #Speaker You
What?!

    #Speaker Narrator
A pair of white skin wings sprout from her back and she takes off flying into the sky carrying you. Bolts keep flying in your direction but none connect with you and both of you fly off into the horizon.

    #Place Mountain
After flying for a long time you land on a mountain. After a few minutes the mountain gradually becomes shrouded by dark clouds. Both of you are safe, but for how long.

* [We are okay.] 

I'm okay, you're okay, we're okay.

    #Emotion Happy
    #Speaker Eira
Seems like it, yes. What will you do now? You have been brought into all of this mess because of me.

    ** I knew what I was getting myself into.

= love

    #Emotion Sad
    #Speaker Eira
I tried so hard...

    #Speaker You
What did you try?

    #Speaker Eira
I tried so hard not to fall in love with you, but you kept giving me a treatment no one has ever given a monster before. Before I knew it, I found myself caring deeply for you. And that feeling grew even stronger with time.

    #Emotion Embarrassed
    #Speaker Eira
I love you, crazily so.

* I'm sorry.

    I wouldn't know how to love you, we are too different. I cannot say I don't feel anyhing for you, but this I feel is not the love a couple feels, but a platonic one.
    
    #Emotion Sad
    #Speaker Eira
    I... Undestand. I'm fine with just standing by as we are, as long as I can stay with you.
    
    -> roamers

* I love you too.

    #Emotion Overjoyed
    #Speaker Eira
    What?! Are you serious?! But I'm a monster and-
    
        ** [*Kiss her*]
        
    #Emotion Blush
    #Speaker Narrator
            You fix your eyes into her lips, moving fast, making excuses out of fear of you loving her back. You feel the urge to make them stop and you move closer and closer until there is no space between hers and yours.
            
    #Speaker Narrator
            She tenses up out of surprise, but responds in kind to your advance. And for a while everything stops around the both of you.
            
    #Speaker Narrator
            You ease up and press your forehead against hers.
            
    #Speaker You
            Do you think I care what they say you are?
            
    #Speaker Narrator
            She smiles with a brightness you had never seen before coming from her and for the first time since you met Eira, you feel like she really means that smile.
    
            -> roamers
        
        ** You are not.
            
            Stop saying that. You are a normal woman who wants to live in peace. Who cares about your race, or would you say elves are not people? Or dwarves are not people? Or we humans? What makes you different?
            
    #Emotion Smile
    #Speaker Narrator
            She wraps her arms around you tightly and you embrace her back. For a moment time seems to stop around you and you feel like nothing really matters as long as you can be together.
    
            -> roamers

= roamers

    #Emotion Happy
    #Speaker Eira
Would you walk this path of continuous hiding and running away with me?

    #Speaker Narrator
Better to do it together than each by ourselves. Don't you think.

    #Speaker Narrator
Together now and forever, the couple of eternal winter marched into the horizon living a life of persecution. Their lives were chaotic and filled with aggression towards them, but happier nonetheless, now that they had each other to rely on.

-> END
=== bolt_death ===

    #Speaker Narrator
You quickly push Eira out of the way and feel a sharp pain go through you. You fall to the ground and feel a warmth in your chest and drive your hand across it. You look at it and find it completely bloodied.

    #???
I said no funny business, didn't I?

->death

= death

    #Emotion Overjoyed
    #Speaker Narrator
Eira lifts your body between her arms and looks at you in abject horror.

    #Speaker You
You're crying... Shh, it's okay. You have to run now. Otherwise they w-will catch you.

    #Speaker Eira
Please, don't leave me. You gave me everything...

    #Speaker Narrator
She clutches your hand in hers, you can feel her cold skin. Her grip is really firm and tightens with every second.

* I love you.

    Gods, I wish I h-had *cough* said it sooner.
    
    #Speaker Eira
    What are you saying right now?! I'm a monster, I kill everything I come close to.
    
    #Speaker You
    You are not. Just listen, I d-don't have much *cough* time left.
    
    I *cough* want you to know that I-
    
    #Speaker Eira
    { affection >= 5: Her lips cut you mid-sentence as they meet with yours. You can feel her answer in the passion of the moment. | I can't love you back, I don't know how to. }
    
    #Speaker Eira
    You can't leave, I wouldn't know what to do...
    
    #Speaker You
    I'm *cough* s-sorry.
    
    #Speaker Narrator
    Your vision fades to black slowly but, you are not alone. You feel Eira's arms tighten around you body. The grip weakens and you see her figure transmogrify into a gargantuan white figure. Your eyes close one last time, but before leaving you hear one last thig. 
    
    #Speaker Eira
    { affection >=5: I will forever love you too. | It's okay, I'm here. }
    
    -> END
    
* Leave.

    You have suffered enough. You deserve a life of your own.
    
    #Speaker Eira
    No, please... Please...
    
    #Speaker Narrator
    Bolts pierce the air once again as your conciousness begins to fade. You feel Eira's tears impact against your skin the last thing you see is Eira's visage shift from teary sadness to murderous intent.
    
    #Speaker Narrator
    A white shadow towers over your body and you depart hearing a roar of anguish and sadness.
